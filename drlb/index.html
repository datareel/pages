The DataReel load balancer (LB) is a software based TCP load balancing
solution designed to run on Linux operating systems. The DRLB project
was designed to handle any type of TCP connection, acting as a front
end server distributing high volumes of TCP connections to multiple
back end servers. Load balancing protects your back end servers from
saturation when you have more clients connection than any one server
can handle. The DRLB server can be used as a high availability
resources to provide seamless server fail over. In signal server
environments the DRLB server can provide connection limits and cached
buffing.
<br /><br />
The DRLB source code is distributed as an open source project under
the GNU general public license and can used by freely by commercial,
Government, and academic institutions.

Developers, follow the instructions below to build the DRLB server:
<pre>
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir -pv git
$ cd $HOME/git
$ git clone https://github.com/datareel/datareel
$ source $HOME/git/datareel/env/gnu_env.sh
$ cd $HOME/git/datareel/load_balancer/drlb_server
$ make
</pre>
Build a default configuration to test with:
<pre>
$ ./drlb_server --verbose --debug --config-file=/tmp/lb_test_config.cfg
</pre>
The default configuration file is set up for 4 back end nodes running
Apache and the frontend LB listening on port 8080. NOTE: For testing
port 8080 is used so the LB server can be started without root
privileges. The default configuration file is documented with
comments. As set of example config files in the etc directory: 
<pre>
$ ls -l $HOME/git/datareel/load_balancer/etc
</pre>
Once your configuration is set up, run a test with debug and logging enabled:
<pre>
$ ./drlb_server --verbose --debug --config-file=/tmp/lb_test_config.cfg --log-file=/tmp/lb_test.log
</pre>

Building a default configuration file:
-------------------------------------
The DRLB server is deigned as generic load balancer and can handle
many LB configurations. To build an LB configuration start with a
generic template. To build a configuration template, run the following
command: 

# /usr/sbin/drlb_server --check-config --config-file=/etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

Running DRLB configuration check and exiting
Loading or building config file http_lb.cfg
DRLB configuration file not found. Building default file and exiting

Test DRLB configurations files:
------------------------------
After editing a DRLB configuration file you must check your
configuration file for errors before starting the DRLB server:

# /usr/sbin/drlb_server --check-config --config-file=/etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg | grep -i -E &#39;error|warn|fail|info|notice&#39;

If you have any errors or warnings, review and edit your configuration file:

# /usr/sbin/drlb_server --check-config --config-file=/etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

Running DRLB as a service:
-------------------------
DRLB is designed to run multiple load balancer configurations on
single Linux server. When the drlb_server service is started, the
service initialization script checks the following file for active
server configurations:

/etc/drlb/active_configs.list

To add configurations, edit the active configs list:

# vi /etc/drlb/active_configs.list

# List of active DRLB configurations
# Below is an example config file. Remove line below after testing.

/etc/drlb/http_rr_test.cfg
/etc/drlb/ldm_cluster.cfg

# List all the LB configs you need to start on this server.
# All entries must use an absolute path to the .cfg file.

Save your changes and exit vi.

If you want to use a single configuration or override the DRLB service 
defaults, edit the following file:

# vi /etc/sysconfig/drlb_server

# File used to override the init script VARs

# Set to change the name of the server binary
##LBPROCNAME=&quot;drlb_server&quot;

# Set to change the path to the server binary
##LBPROC=&quot;/usr/sbin/${LBPROCNAME}&quot;

# Set to change location of active config list
##ACTIVE_CONFIGS=&quot;/etc/drlb/active_configs.list&quot;

# NOTE: Set for single config if you wish to run only on LB server
###SINGLECONFIG=/etc/drlb/http_rr_test.cfg

After setting up your DRLB configuration files and your active
configuration list, start the DRCM
server and make the DRCM service persistent:

RHEL 7/CENTOS 7:

# systemctl start drlb_server
# systemctl status drlb_server
# systemctl enable drcm_server

RHEL 6/CENTOS 6:

# service drlb_server start
# service drlb_server status
# chkconfig drcm_server on

Setting the listening port:
--------------------------
The DRLB server listens for incoming TCP connections on a port number
specified in the global server configuration. The DRLB server
distributes incoming TCP connections to back end server nodes. In
the DRLB configuration you are setting up for a load balanced service
you must specify the front and listening port in the global
[LBSERVER] config section. For each back end node you must specify the
back end listening port for each&#39;s node [LBNODE] config section. For
example, if you created a configuration template named “http_lb.cfg”
make the following entries to set the listening ports. NOTE: The
port numbers used in the example below must be substituted with the
port number you are actually using. The use of 4 LBNODE sections is
just an example. Your setup can contain any number of LBNODE sections
depending on how may back end server nodes you have available.     

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
port = 8080 # All incoming traffic connections here 
...

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode1
port_number = 80 # Port backend host is listening on
...

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode2
port_number = 80
...

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode3
port_number = 80
...

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode4
port_number = 80
...

NOTE: For developers, if your [LBSERVER] port is less than 1024 you
will require root privileges to start the DRLB program for testing.

NOTE: For system administrators, you are still required to adhere to
all your required service security settings on each back end LB node.

Round robin configuration: 
-------------------------
The round robin load balancing scheme distributes TCP connections
equally to all back end server nodes. For round robin to work
efficiently on bare metal servers, each back end server should have
the same or very similar hardware specifications. For virtual machines
each back end server should be setup with the same amount of CPU,
memory, and disk image parameters. To select round robin, set the
[LBSERVER] scheme to  LB_RR. The [LBNODE] sections require a node
name, port number, and the node&#39;s IP address. For example:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
scheme = LB_RR

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode1
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.111

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode2
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.112

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode3
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.113

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode4
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.114

NOTE: The port numbers in the above example must be substituted
with the port number you are actually using. The use of 4 LBNODE
sections is just an example. Your setup may contain any number of
LBNODE sections depending on how many back end server nodes you have
available.  

Weighted configuration:
----------------------
The weighed round robin load balancing scheme distributes TCP
connections based on a weight value you assign to each back end server
node. Weighted round robin allows you to use servers with different
hardware configurations, where one or more back end server cannot
handle the same load as other servers. The DRLB weight value
represents a number of connection per node. The nodes with the highest
weight values will get the most connections. The nodes with the lowest
weight values will get the lease number of connections. To select
weighted round robin, set the [LBSERVER]  scheme to LB_WEIGHTED. The
[LBNODE] sections require a node name, port number, the node&#39;s IP
address, and a weight value. 

In the example below, lbnode4 will carry 4 times the amount of
connection than lbnode3, and lbnode1 and lbnode2. Lbnode3 will carry 3
time the amount of connections than lbnode1 and lbnode2. Lbnode1 and
lbnode2 will get the lease amount of connections. For example:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
scheme = LB_WEIGHTED

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode1
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.111
weight = 1

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode2
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.112
weight = 1

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode3
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.113
weight = 2

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode4
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.114
weight = 3

NOTE: The port numbers in the above example must be substituted
with the port number you are actually using. The use of 4 LBNODE
sections is just an example. Your setup may contain any number of
LBNODE sections depending on how many back end server nodes you have
available.  

Distributed configuration:
-------------------------
The distributed load balancing scheme distributes TCP connections
based on a percentage value you assign to each back end server
node. Similar to weighted round robin, distributed load balancing
allows you to use servers with different hardware configurations,
where one or more back end server cannot handle the same load as other
servers. The main difference is load distribution is based on a
percentage rather then a weight value. To select distributed load
balancing, set the [LBSERVER] scheme to LB_DISTRIB. The [LBNODE]
sections require a node name, port number, the node&#39;s IP address, and
a percentage value. The nodes with the highest percent values will get
the most connections. The nodes with the lowest percent values will
get the lease number of connections. 

In the example below, lbnode4 will carry 40% of total
connections. Lbnode3 will carry 30% of the total connections. Lbnode1
and lbnode2 will carry 15% of the total connections. For example: 

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
scheme = LB_DISTRIB

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode1
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.111
weight = 15%

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode2
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.112
weight = 15%

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode3
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.113
weight = %30

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode4
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.114
weight = 40%

NOTE: The port numbers in the above example must be substituted
with the port number you are actually using. The use of 4 LBNODE
sections is just an example. Your setup may contain any number of
LBNODE sections depending on how many back end server nodes you have
available.  

Assigned configuration:
----------------------
The assigned load balancing scheme allow you assign TCP connections to
specific back end nodes based on the IP address of the incoming
connection. Incoming connections that do not have assignment rules can
be configured to use round robin, weighted, or distributed load
balancing schemes. The same load balancing scheme used for unassigned
connections will be applied to down server nodes handling connection
assignment rules. To select assigned load balancing, set the
[LBSERVER]  scheme to LB_ASSIGNED.  The [LBNODE] sections require a
node name, port number, and the node&#39;s IP address.  In the  [LBSERVER]
section, the assigned_default can be set to: 

LB_RR
LB_DISTRIB
LB_WEIGHTED
LB_NONE

If you select LB_DISTRIB, each [LBNODE] section will require a
percentage value set for the weight value. If you select LB_WEIGHTED,
each  [LBNODE] section will require a weight value.  

The LB_NONE setting will not connection assigned connections to
another node if the node handling the assignment rules is down.
LB_NONE will use round robin for all incoming connections with no
assignment rules.  

The assigned load balancing scheme requires a rules configuration
file, set in the [LBSERVER] section&#39;s rules_config_file setting, for
example:

rules_config_file = /etc/drlb/http_lb_rules.cfg

If the rules file does not exist, a default file will be created for
you. 

Below is a an assigned load balance configuration use round robin as
the default for 4 back end server nodes:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
scheme = LB_ASSIGNED
rules_config_file = /etc/drlb/http_lb_rules.cfg
assigned_default = LB_RR

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode1
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.111

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode2
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.112

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode3
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.113

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode4
port_number = 80
hostname = 192.168.122.114

NOTE: The port numbers in the above example must be substituted
with the port number you are actually using. The use of 4 LBNODE
sections is just an example. Your setup may contain any number of
LBNODE sections depending on how many back end server nodes you have
available.  

After modifing the DRLB configuration, add your assignment rules to
the rules configuration file. Each assignment rule is designated be
the route key word followed by the IP address of the incoming
conenction and the name of the back end server node handling the
assignment. The IP address for the incoming connections can be an IP
address value or a regular expression. To setup rules, edit the rules
file:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb_rules.cfg

route 192.168.122.1 lbnode1
route ^10.* lbnode2
route ^172\.31\.1.* lbnode3

In the examples above, the first route rule directs all traffic from
the 192.168.122.1 IP address to lbnode1. The second example directs
all traffic from the 10.0.0.0/8 network to lbnode2. The third example
directs all traffic from the 172.31.1.0/24 network to lbnode3. All
other incoming traffic will use round robin connections to node 1
through 4. 

The assignment rules file is read when the DRLB server starts or is
restarted. Changes to the rules file require a service restart to take
affect.

Throttling configuration:
------------------------
Connection throttling can be used to prevent server saturation by
placing incoming connection into a wait queue. Throttling can be base
on a preset connection count or based on the number of incoming
connections per second. 

To setup a preset connection throttle, edit your DRLB configuration
file an add the following to the [LBSERVER] global configuration
section: 

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
enable_throttling = 1
throttle_every_connections = 10
throttle_wait_secs = 1
throttle_wait_usecs = 0

In the example above every 10 connections will be throttled with a
wait queue time of 1 second. If throttle_every_connections is set to
1, every incoming connection will be throttled. 

To setup connection per second throttling, edit your DRLB configuration
file an add the following to the [LBSERVER] global configuration
section:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
enable_throttling = 1
throttle_apply_by_load = 1
throttle_connections_per_sec = 10
throttle_every_connections = 10
throttle_wait_secs = 1
throttle_wait_usecs = 0

In the example above every 10 connections will be throttled when the
incoming server load reaches 10 connection per second. When the load
drops below 10 connections per second, throttling will be disabled
until the load spikes again to 10 per second. By default, statistics
collection is every 5 minutes. You can increase or decrease stat
collection time by setting the following global configuration values:

stats_min = 5
stats_secs = 0

Log configuration: 
-----------------
DRLB server logging is disabled by default. To get maximum server
performance under extreme load conditions you may want to leave
logging disabled or set the log level to zero. To enable logging ,
edit your DRLB configuration file an add the following to the
[LBSERVER] global configuration
section:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
enable_logging = 1
logfile_name = /var/log/drlb/http_lb.log
num_logs_to_keep = 3
max_log_size = 5000000
clear_log = 0
log_level = 0

In the above example the DRLB server will log to http_lb.log file. The
maximum log file size will be 5MB and we will the current log file and
3 previous copies. The required disk space for log files is equal to:

max_log_size * (num_logs_to_keep +1)

The log_level can be set to 0 (lowest) level or 5 (highest) level. The
higher the log level, the more messages will be logged.

To increase server performance you have the option to adjust the
advanced DRLB log setting: 

log_queue_size = 2048
log_queue_debug_size = 4096
log_queue_proc_size = 255

The log queue size equals the number of log messages the server will
spool. Memory usage is equal to:

log_queue_size * 255

Spooling more messages to memory will decrease the consecutive number
of log file writes. The debug queue size only applies if debugging is
enabled. The proc queue size is used for process messages and does not
need to be very large as process messages are written during server
stops, starts, restarts, or process error conditions.  

To watch the log in real time:

# tail -f /var/log/drlb/http_lb.log

Statistics collection:
---------------------
DRLB server statistics collection is disabled by default. To enable
stat collection, edit your DRLB configuration file an add the
following to the [LBSERVER] global configuration
section:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
enable_stats = 1
stats_file_name = /var/log/drlb/http_lb_stats.log
max_stats_size = 5000000
num_stats_to_keep = 3
stats_min = 5
stats_secs = 0

In the above example the DRLB server will collect server stats every 5
minutes and write the stat messages to log to http_lb.log file. The
maximum stat file size will be 5MB and we will the current stats file
and 3 previous copies. The required disk space for stat files is equal
to:

max_stats_size * (num_stats_to_keep +1)

You can increase or decrease stat collection times by adjusting the
stats_min and stats_secs values.

To watch the stats in real time:

# tail -f /var/log/drlb/http_lb_stats.log

Setting connection and thread limits:
------------------------------------
To protect low resource servers from saturation you set connection
limits. Connection limits will stop serving connections when the
maximum number connections are reached. Connection limits can be set
for all back end server nodes or for individual back end server
nodes. To set connection limits for all back end nodes edit your DRLB
server configuration and add the following  to the [LBSERVER] section:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
max_connections = 1000

This will limit the total number of concurrent connections to
1000. When the 1000 connection limit is reached the DRLB server will
not allow any more connections until the total number of connection
drops below 1000.

To set the number of connections for individual back end nodes:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode1
max_connections = 1000

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode2
max_connections = 200

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode3
max_connections = 200

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode4
max_connections = 200

The will limit lbnode1 to 1000 connections and lbnode2 through lbnode4
to 200 connections each.

To limit the number of threads the DRLB server process can generate
you can set the max_threads limit in the [LBSERVER] section:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
max_threads = 1000

Limiting the number of threads the process can generate will limit all
server connection depending on how many client threads are
active. Thread limit protects server resources when there is a large
number of persistent client connections. 

Setting buffer and caching options:
----------------------------------
Caching is used by default to buffer incoming connections as data is
read from TCP socket connections. In certain network environments it
may be necessary to disable cache buffering or change the default
buffer size. Lowing the buffer size will result in more reads per
connection. Increasing the buffer size will decrease the number of
reads per connection. To set the cache or buffer size settings for all
nodes, edit your configuration file and modify the following
parameters in the [LBSERVER] section:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
use_buffer_cache = 1
buffer_size = 1500

To set buffer size for individual nodes:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode1
buffer_size = 1500
...

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode2
buffer_size = 1500
...

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode3
buffer_size = 1500
...

[LBNODE]
node_name = lbnode4
buffer_size = 1500
...

Dead node retry settings:
------------------------
When a back end server node is down for maintenance or hardware
failures you can change the number of retires and the wait time for
retries. To change the retry values, edit your configuration file and
modify the following parameters in the [LBSERVER] section:

[LBSERVER]
...
retries = 3
retry_wait = 1

Buffer overflow settings:
------------------------
When cache buffer is enable you can enable buffer overflow protection,
provided you know the packet sizes your application uses. With buffer
overflow protection enable, the DRLB server will deny a connection if
the number of bytes read on a front end socket connection exceeds the
buffer overflow size. To enable buffer overflow protection edit your
configuration file and modify the following parameters in the
[LBSERVER] section: 

[LBSERVER]
...
enable_buffer_overflow_detection = 1
buffer_overflow_size = 5000

This will limit incoming socket reads to 5000 bytes per connection.

Advanced socket settings:
------------------------
Each of the setting below are set in the [LBSERVER] global section in
your DRLB server configuration file.

To change the maximum number of back logged connection, set the
somaxconn parameter based on the  kernel setting:

# cat  /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn 

Typically the default value 128 and the maximum value is 1024. If this
value is higher on your server you can adjust your DRLB configuration:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
somaxconn = 1024

Depending on your application you may need adjust the DRLB socket
options to prevent CPU usage spikes. To adjust the socket options edit
the following options in your configuration file:

# vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
# Idle time for blocking sockets
max_idle_count = 60000
idle_wait_secs = 0
idle_wait_usecs = 500

# Use non-blocking sockets
use_nonblock_sockets = 0

The idle time setting adjustment are most effective for a large number
of persistent connections. For connections that stay open for long
periods without transferring data, increasing the values will reduce
CPU usage. Decreasing the idle times or using non-blocking sockets is
most affective for connections that rapidly open and close.

For applications that rely on timing for socket reads you can set your
DRLB configuration to use blocking reads with timeout values:

 # vi /etc/drlb/http_lb.cfg

[LBSERVER]
...
use_buffer_cache = 0
use_timeout = 1
timeout_secs = 300
timeout_usecs = 0

This will disable the buffer cache and set the read timeout value to
300 seconds. If the socket connection does not receive data within 300
seconds the connection will close. 

DRLB process monitoring:
-----------------------
Use the shell commands below to watch DRLB CPU, memory, file, and
thread resources.

Watch percentage of memory:

$ watch -n 1 &#39;ps -eo %mem,pid,user,args | grep drlb | grep -v grep&#39;

Watch percentage of CPU:

$ watch -n 1 &#39;ps -eo %cpu,pid,user,args | grep drlb | grep -v grep&#39;

Watch percentage of CPU and memory:

$ watch -n 1 &#39;ps -eo %cpu,%mem,pid,etime,args | grep drlb | grep -v grep&#39;

Watch memory usage:

$ pids=$(ps -ef | grep drlb_server | grep -v grep | awk &#39;{ print $2 }&#39;)
$ for p in $pids; do cat /proc/$p/status | grep -i vmsize; done

Watch number of threads:

$ pids=$(ps -ef | grep drlb_server | grep -v grep | awk &#39;{ print $2 }&#39;)
$ for p in $pids; do cat /proc/$p/status | grep -i threads; done

Watch number of open files:

$ pids=$(ps -ef | grep drlb_server | grep -v grep | awk &#39;{ print $2 }&#39;)
$ for p in $pids; do ls -l --color=none /proc/$p/fd; done

Load balancing will require kernel tuning based the volume of traffic
and type of TCP service you are load balancing. NOTE: The values in
listed below are based on extremely high volume. Depending on your
application you may not need to set many of the parameters listed. But
please keep in mind that you will need to tune the kernel for any
server acting as a load balancer. 
<br /><br />
All setting listed below must be application tested and set based on
the number of connections to your frontend LB and backend hosts. For
each of the settings below use the sysctl command to backup the
orginal changes before making any changes, for example:
<br /><br />
# sysctl fs.file-max | tee -a /root/sysctl_org_settings.txt
<br /><br />
To make the changes persistent, add the setting(s) to the sysctl.conf
file: 
<br /><br />
CENTOS 5/6 or RHEL 5/6:<br />
# vi /etc/sysctl.conf
<br /><br />
CENTOS 7 or RHEL 7:<br />
# vi /usr/lib/sysctl.d/00-system.conf
<br /><br />
To load changes CENTOS 5/6 or RHEL 5/6:<br />
# sysctl -p
<br /><br />
To load changes CENTOS 7 or RHEL 7:<br />     
# sysctl -p  /usr/lib/sysctl.d/00-system.conf
<pre>
File Handle Limits:
------------------
Increase the maximum number of open file descriptors:

fs.file-max = 25000000

IPv4 Socket Tuning:
------------------
For a large numbers of concurent sessions:

net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 60
net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 4096

net.core.somaxconn = 1024

IPv4 Settings:

net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv4.ipfrag_max_dist = 4096
net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1

Process Scheduler:
-----------------
Increase time for process run time before the kernel will consider
migrating it again to another core: 

CENTOS 5/6 or RHEL 5/6:

kernel.sched_migration_cost = 5000000

CENTOS 7 or RHEL 7:

kernel.sched_migration_cost_ns = 5000000

kernel.sched_autogroup_enabled = 0

Threads:
-------
Increase maximum number of threads that can be created by a process:

kernel.threads-max = 5000000

A simple way to test your DRLB server to use Apache on KVM virtual
machines. Once you have Apache running on a one or more virtual
machines copy the following PHP scripts to the Web root on each VM,
for example 
<pre>
$ cd $HOME/git/datareel/load_balancer/apache_test
$ chmod 644 *.php

$ for s in 192.168.122.111 192.168.122.112 192.168.122.113 192.168.122.114 
&gt; do
&gt; scp -p *.php root@${s}:/var/www/html/.
&gt; done

$ cd $HOME/git/datareel/load_balancer/drlb_server
$ ./drlb_server --config-file=../etc/http_rr_test.cfg --log-file=/tmp/http_rr.log &gt; /tmp/drlb_start.log &amp;
</pre>
To connect using wget, assuming the DRLB server is listening on port
8080 on the bare metal host:
<pre>
$ cd /tmp
$ wget -O index.html http://192.168.122.1:8080
</pre>
Persistent TCP connection:
<pre>
$ wget -O loop1.txt http://192.168.122.1:8080
</pre>
NOTE: If you testing using Firefox, you will be limited to 6
persistent session. By default Firefox only allow 6 simultaneous
downloads. To
increase this limit for testing, enter the following URL: 
<br /><br />
about:config
<br /><br />
Search for:
<br /><br />
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server
<br /><br />
Change the default from 6 to a higher number.
